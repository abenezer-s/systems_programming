# unixshell - A Minimal Interactive Shell in C

## Overview

**`unixshell`** is a simple, interactive Unix shell written in C. It allows users to execute commands, perform basic job control, and supports a small set of built-in commands. The shell is designed to demonstrate core concepts of shell development, including lexical analysis, syntactical analysis, process management and dynamic memory management.

## Modules

The project is divided into five key modules, each handling different parts of the shell's functionality:

1. **`ish.c`** - The core module that drives the shell. It handles input/output operations, user prompts, and the main shell loop.
2. **`lex_analysis.c`** - This module performs lexical analysis, parsing user input into tokens that the shell can process.
3. **`synt_analysis.c`** - This module handles the syntactical analysis, interpreting the parsed tokens and converting them 
4. **`process_management.c`** - This module is responsible for managing processes in the shell. 
into meaningful actions.
5. **`dynarray.c`** - A utility module providing dynamic array functionality, used to manage memory efficiently for storing command arguments and other dynamic data.

## Features

- **Interactive Shell**: Prompts the user for input, executes commands, and displays output.
- **Built-in Commands**: Supports common commands like `exit` or `ctrl + \` to terminate the shell.
- **Tokenization**: Uses lexical analysis to break down user input into tokens.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Checks the syntactical structure of commands to ensure valid execution.

## How It Works

1. **Input Prompt**: The shell continuously prompts the user for input.
2. **Lexical Analysis**: The input string is passed to the `lex_analysis.c` module to break it down into tokens (words, operators, etc.).
3. **Syntactical Analysis**: The tokens are then passed to `synt_analysis.c` to analyze the structure of the input and decide what action to take.
4. **Command Execution**: The shell either runs a built-in command or executes an external command by forking a child process.
5. **Memory Management**: Dynamic memory for managing command arguments is handled using the `dynarray.c` module.

## Building the Shell

To compile and run the shell, you can use the provided `Makefile`. The `Makefile` will compile all the source files and link them into an executable called `ish`.

### Steps to Compile

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. **Compile the Shell**:
   In the project directory, run the following command to compile the shell:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will generate an executable called `ish`.

3. **Run the Shell**:
   To run the shell, simply execute the `ish` program:

   ```bash
   ./ish
   ```

   This will start the interactive shell. You will see a prompt (`%`), where you can type commands and see the output.

4. **Clean Up**:
   To remove the compiled files (such as the executable and object files), run:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## Usage

Once the shell is running, it will prompt you for input. You can type commands at the prompt and press Enter to execute them.

### Example Commands:

- **Run a built-in command**:
  ```bash
  exit
  ```
  This command will terminate the shell.

- **Run an external command**:
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```
  This will list the contents of the current directory.

- **Command with arguments**:
  ```bash
  echo "Hello, World!"
  ```
  This will print "Hello, World!" to the screen.

## Files

### `ish.c`
- The main shell program that handles the user interface, input/output, and manages the command execution loop.

### `lex_analysis.c`
- This module handles the lexical analysis of user input. It reads the input string, breaks it down into individual tokens (such as words, operators, and special characters), and returns the tokenized result.

### `synt_analysis.c`
- This module is responsible for analyzing the structure of the tokens generated by lexical analysis. It checks whether the input is syntactically correct and performs any required transformations (e.g., handling pipes or redirects).

### `dynarray.c`
- This utility module implements dynamic arrays, allowing flexible storage of command arguments and other data that may grow or shrink during execution.

## Example Output

```bash
% ls
dynarray.c  ish    lex_analysis.c  makefile		process_managment.h  synt_analysis.c  token.c
dynarray.h  ish.c  lex_analysis.h  process_managment.c	README.md	     synt_analysis.h  token.h
% echo "Hello, Shell!"
Hello, Shell!
% exit
```
